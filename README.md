✨ Just Launched: Apple Vision Pro Website Clone 🖥️
I'm excited to share my latest front-end project — a fully responsive Apple Vision Pro website replica, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
🔧 What I built:
A sleek, modern landing page inspired by Apple’s clean aesthetic
Responsive design for desktop and mobile views
Smooth animations and interactive elements using vanilla JavaScript
Focus on pixel-perfect layout and user experience
💻 Technologies Used:
HTML5 for structure
CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, transitions) for styling
JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic behavior
🌐 Live Demo: https://lnkd.in/gRi7rzpf
 📂 GitHub Repository: https://lnkd.in/g6sQgT3Z
This project helped me dive deeper into layout techniques, animations, and responsive design principles. Always learning, always building.
I’d appreciate any feedback, and would love to connect with fellow developers and designers!
